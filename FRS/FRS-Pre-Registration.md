# 1. Overview [**[↑]**](#table-of-contents)
The pre-registration module enables a user to book an appointment for one or many Individuals for registration. It allows a user to enter their demographic details and book appointment by choosing a suitable registration center and time slot and then notifies user on a successful booking. This module also has the provision for appointment rescheduling and cancellation.

# 2. Features
## 2.1 Login/Creating a User Account
### 2.1.1 Login using Email [**[↑]**](#table-of-contents)
The Individual can login to the Pre-registration Portal by providing their Email Id. The system validates the email Id, once validated sends an OTP to the email Id as provided. The Individual enters the OTP as received. The system validates the OTP entered and redirects the Individual to fill Demographic form (if first-time) or Dashboard (if existing user).

### 2.1.3 Automatic User ID Creation on First Login [**[↑]**](#table-of-contents)
The Individual logs in to the Pre-Registration portal with their Mobile Number or Email Id. After successful Authentication, the system checks if the Individual is first-time user or not. If the Individual is first-time user, the system creates a new record in the database. All the Pre-registration Ids created from there on will be mapped to this User Id.

## 2.2 Creating an Application
### 2.2.1 Provide Demographic Data [**[↑]**](#table-of-contents)

The Individual is provided with Demographic form based on the [**ID Object Definition**](MOSIP-ID-Object-definition) for new pre-registration application, Individual Fills Demographic Details (e.g., Full Name, Age/DOB, Gender, Residential status, Address, Mobile Number, Email Id, etc.). The system validates the fields entered, the system also checks for the Mandatory fields. Additionally, the system validates for any blacklisted words entered (as configured by the Country)
Once validated the **Pre-Registration Id is generated** (Pre-registration Request Id) and the Demographic details provided gets mapped to that PRID.

Note: Consent is sought from the user for every new application created in the system

### 2.2.2 Provide Consent [**[↑]**](#table-of-contents)

An Individual Logs in to the pre-registration system with Mobile Number or Email ID and then opts to create a new Application form. Before filling the form, the Individual is advised to provide their consent for storage and utilization of their personal information. The consent is sought from the user for every new application created in the system. On providing their consent, the system redirects the Individual to start the Pre-Registration Application (Demographic Details). The data as part of the consent form is rendered as setup by the admin.

In case of closure of the Consent Pop-up, the following scenarios may arise:
1. First-time login: On closure, then system alerts the user that he will be logged out due to not providing consent.
1. Existing User login
   * Scenario 1 Create new Application from Dashboard: On closure, the Individual will be redirected to Dashboard page.
   * Scenario 2 Add Applicant from Preview Page: On closure, the individual will be redirected to Preview Page.


### 2.2.3 Create Multiple Applications [**[↑]**](#table-of-contents)

Once the Demographic Details are filled and the Documents are uploaded, if the Individual wishes to add an applicant, he/she can opt to select 'Add An Applicant' option on the preview page or 'Create New Application' option on the Dashboard. The system provides the Individual with Demographic form based on the defined ID Object Definition to fill. The system associates the pre-registration Id to the new Application(s) created.

### 2.2.4 Provide Data in Preferred Language [**[↑]**](#table-of-contents)

The Individual can select their language of preference, which is referred as Primary (from a list of 2 languages as set by Admin) from the Login screen, the other language from the list is considered as secondary. The Individual can then provide data in the preferred language (primary) as selected. The data in the right side of the Demographic page will be Transliterated to secondary language. The labels in the right hand side will be translated to the Secondary language. The Individual can verify the transliterated data and edit if required. The data will subsequently be stored in the database along with the respective language codes.

_Language Configuration_: 

1. In the below listed scenarios, system will render an error message on the Login page and inhibit Pre-registration, and hence, the language configurations should be appropriately setup by the administrator.
- If Primary Language is set to a specific value and Secondary Language is marked as Null/not set by Admin, or
- If Secondary Language is set to a specific value and Primary Language is marked as Null/not set by Admin, or
- If both Primary and Secondary Language is marked as Null/not set by Admin
(EG: Primary set to English and Secondary not set or vice-versa),  
then system will render the stated Error Message: “The system has encountered a technical error. Administrator to setup the necessary language configuration(s).” The error message will not have an option to exit, hence not allow the user to proceed further. On page refresh, the system will render the error message again and hence, inhibit pre-registrations. 

2. Considering a scenario, wherein if Primary language and Secondary language is configured to be the same, EG: English
then:
- The system will render the demographic page (with both left and right side for Primary and Secondary lnaguage) in the same language
- Values entered on the left side (Primary Language) will not be transliterated but auto-copied on the right side
- Values on the right side will remain un-editable
- As part of the packet, system will send/store data in one language only, if language code is identified to be the same – EG: ENG (English)

Therefore, it is important for the administrator to setup the configurations appropriately.

### 2.2.5 Viewing "My Applications" (covers status) [**[↑]**](#table-of-contents)
The Pre-Registrations created will be associated with User Id. The Individual can view all the Pre-Registrations created by him/her in the Dashboard. The Pre-Registration can be in 3 different status (Pending Appointment, Booked, Expired)

|Status|Explanation|User Action|
|------|-----|-----|
|**Pending Appointment**|Filled only demographic details|Upload documents and book an appointment|
|  |Filled demographic details and uploaded documents |Book an appointment|
|**Booked**|  Filled demographic details, uploaded documents, and booked appointment|Visit the registration center on the appointment date and time|
|**Expired**| Appointed date has passed|N/A

The applications are sorted and displayed by the order of creation of application. The first application created appears first, latest created/modified application appears at the end. If the individual visits the Registration Centre and consumes the appointment, then the application will be removed from the list. If the appointment date has passed, the status changes to "Expired" and is retained on the dashboard for further rebooking/modification as required.
