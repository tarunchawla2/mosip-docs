#  Login 

##  Login

The admin portal integrates with the key cloak IAM to store users and provides login functionality.  When an administrator accesses the homepage or any page on the admin portal through a browser, the portal detects if the administrator is already logged-in or not. If not, the system re-directs the administrator to the key cloak login user interface which requests the administrator for his/her username and password.  After getting the credentials, key cloak verifies the administrator’s credentials and role. It also validates whether the administrator is not deactivated. After successful validation of the credentials, the system then re-directs the administrator to the page he/she initially landed on.

##  Logout

###  Manual logout

If an administrator wishes to logout of the admin portal, he/she can opt to select the logout option from the profile menu on the administrator UI. The system logs out the administrator.

# Account management

Using the portal, user will  manage his/her profile. The  portal users are central admin, central approver, zonal admin, zonal approver, registration center head, registration supervisor, and registration officer.


# Resource management 

##  Center management

Admin portal allows an administrator to manage registration centers, setup by the country for taking registrations of the residents. Center management includes functionalities like viewing, creating, editing, activating, deactivating and decommission of centers. An administrator should have the role of a zonal admin/global admin to do this. A zonal admin/global admin can manage only centers under his/her administrative zone.

### View center 

The admin portal allows an admin to view the list of all registration centers available in the jurisdiction of his/her administrative zone. The system does not fetch the details of decommissioned registration centers but only active and inactive centers. Admin portal UI shows the list of registration centers in only the country configured primary language.

The administrator can filter the list of registration centers based on following parameters:

1. Center name
2. Center type
3. Status
4. Location hierarchy (all location levels)

Besides the list view, an administrator can also view the detail of a registration center by clinking on a center name in the list view. This detail view shows all the details of a registration center in all the country configured languages.

The registration center list view screen is built using a templatized approach. 

### Create center 

An admin can create a center by providing necessary mandatory details. A center needs to be created in both configured primary and secondary language. Although the portal will allow creation of a center in only primary language but will not allow activation of that center until data for that center is not updated for all the languages.
 
A center is created with the following attributes:

Center name, center type, address, latitude, longitude, location, contact phone, contact person, working hours, no. of kiosk, center start time, center end time, lunch start time, lunch end time, time zone, holiday zone and administrative zone the center belongs to. A center can only be mapped to the administrative zone at the lowest zonal hierarchy. While defining centers, An admin can also define the working days of the week for a center and any exceptional holidays that might be applicable for a particular center.  

While entering data through UI in multiple languages, the dropdown values and numeric values entered in primary language gets automatically captured in all language. But the text fields (e.g., center name) needs to be manually input in all the languages.

###  Update center

Once a center is created, an admin can edit a center later if required. The update can include adding the details in another required language that were missed during creation of the center or changing the details of a center itself.  

All the attributes mentioned in the 'Create center' section can be updated for a center.

###  Activate/Deactivate/Decommission center 

An admin can deactivate or decommission a center through the admin portal.

Deactivation refers to a temporary shut down while decommission refers to a permanent shut down of the center. Decommissioning a center also automatically deactivates the center. In cases, where a center has some resources mapped to it (e.g. machines, devices or users), the portal won't allow the admin to decommission such a center. 

Difference between deactivated and decommissioned center is that a deactivated center can later be activated later through admin portal as required by the country. But a decommissioned center cannot be bought into commission again as decommission refers to a permanent shutdown. To reactivate such a center (if decommissioned by mistake), the admin must directly update the database through the back-end scripts.

## Machine management 

Admin portal allows an administrator to manage machines the country will use for taking registration of the residents. The definition of machine is the device on which the registration client is installed. Machine management includes viewing, creating, editing, activating, deactivating and decommission of machines.

### Activate/Deactivate/Decommission machine 

An admin can deactivate or decommission a machine through the admin portal. 

Deactivation refers to a temporary shut down while decommission refers to a permanent shut down of the machine. Decommissioning a machine also automatically deactivates the machine. In cases, where a machine is mapped to any center, the portal won't allow the admin to decommission such a machine. 

Difference between deactivated and decommissioned machine is that a deactivated machine can later be activated through admin portal after a period as required by the country. But a decommissioned machine cannot be bought into commission again as decommission refers to a permanent shutdown. To reactivate such a machine (if decommissioned by mistake), the admin must directly update the database through the back-end scripts.

###  Map/Un-map/Re-map Machine to a Center 

Admin portal allows an admin to map machines to a center. This mapping specifies as to which center the machine will be used in. A machine can only be mapped to a center which belongs under the machines’ administrative zone.

A machine can later be un-mapped from the center in cases where a machine is needed to be moved to another center. In such cases, the machine will later need to be mapped to the new center. In case the machine is required to be mapped to a registration center outside the administrative zonal restriction, the administrative zone of the machine must be changed. 

##  Device Management

In case the User is required to be mapped to a Registration Center outside the Administrative Zonal Restriction, the Administrative Zone of the User must be changed.

## Administrative Zone Management 

Administrative Zones are virtual boundaries which a country can define to better manage their resources which are used during registrations. These resources includes Centers, Users, Machines and Devices. These zones can be defined in a hierarchical fashion and a country can allocate resources to such zones based on their requirements. 

Resources under each zone is managed by a Zonal Admin. This is done by assigning an Administrative zone to the Zonal Admin during user creation. These Zonal Admins can exist at any zonal hierarchy. (For e.g, a Zonal Admin can directly be mapped to the whole country as a Zone or can be mapped to a significantly smaller zone such as a city). Thus these resources when mapped to an Administrative Zone can only be managed by the Admin of that Zone.

Moreover, the admin can also choose to send notification to an additional recipient by giving the recipient's email id or mobile number or both.  

# Packet Status Check (based on RID) 

A Registration packet generated in Registration Client is sent to Registration Processor for further processing and UIN generation.  Using the Portal, A Zonal Admin can view the status of a packet by giving the RID of the packet. The packet status will contain all the stages the packet has passed through along with the last stage the packet is in. In case the packet has not been processed or is marked for Re-Send/Re-Register, the admin will be able to view specific comments indicating the reason for that particular status.

# Device Provider Management 

All the bio-metric devices which will be used for Authentication and Registration needs to be registered with MOSIP. Unless these devices are not registered, they cannot be used for capturing resident Bio-metrics for registrations or authentication.

For managing these devices, MOSIP needs to store details of following four entities:

1. Device Provider
2. Foundational Trust Providers
3. MOSIP Complaint MDS services
4. Biometric Devices (Registered and White-listed)

## Device Providers (Create/Update) 

Device Providers are the vendors supplying devices for Registration or Authentication. This device provides are needed to be registered before the devices of this providers are getting registered. 

An MOSIP Administrator can register each Device Provider with MOSIP by storing the attributes Vendor Name, Vendor Address, Contact Number, Email, Status (Active/Inactive) and Certificate Alias. The status of a Device Provider is automatically marked as ‘Active’ during the creation. After successful registration, a unique Device Provider ID is generated by MOSIP for each device provider. In case a device provider is getting registered with an already existing name and address, Admin portal won’t allow the creation of such a Provider.

Admin portal will also allow an Admin to update details of the Device Provider including the Name, Address, Contact Details and Status. Changing the status from Active to Inactive will render that provider inactive and any biometric received from a device of such a provider will fail the validation checks and thus rejecting the Auth/Registration request. Any creation and modification in the details of a Device Providers is maintained in a history table to future references.

## Foundational Trust Providers (Create/Update) 

MOSIP will use two types of devices. L0 devices (encryption is done on the host machine device driver or the MOSIP device service) and L1 (capable of performing encryption in device’s trusted module). A Foundational Trust Provider provides this module which is then put in the L1 devices during manufacturing. These Foundational Trust Providers are identified before-hand and are registered with MOSIP. 

An MOSIP Administrator can register each Foundational Trust Provider with MOSIP by storing the attributes Trust Providers Name, Trust Providers Address, Contact Number, Email, Status (Active/Inactive) and Certificate Alias. The status of a Foundational Trust Provider is automatically marked as ‘Active’ during the creation. After successful registration, a unique Foundational Trust Provider ID is generated by MOSIP for each Foundational Trust Provider. In case a Foundational Trust Provider is getting registered with an already existing name and address, Admin portal won’t allow the creation of such a Trust Provider.

Admin portal will also allow an Admin to update details of the Foundational Trust Provider including the Name, Address, Contact Details and Status. Any creation and modification in the details of a Foundational Trust Providers is maintained in a history table to future references.

## MOSIP Complaint MDS services (Create/Update) 

Every Registration/Auth Device needs to use a MDS (MOSIP Device Service) to communicate with MOSIP. Each MDS needs to be registered before-hand with the MOSIP.  A MOSIP Administrator can register each MDS with MOSIP by storing the attributes Software Version, Provider ID, Device Type Code, Device Sub-Type, Make, Model, Software Created Date, Software Expiry Date and Software’s Binary hash. The status of a MDS is automatically marked as ‘Active’ during the creation. After successful registration, a unique Service ID is generated by MOSIP for each MDS. 

There will always be a unique service ID of an MDS against a unique combination of a Software Version, Provider ID, Device Type, Device Sub Type, Make and Model. Thus, no two MDS can exist with same above-mentioned combination. 
Admin portal will also allow an Admin to update details of an MDS. Any creation and modification in the details of a MDS is maintained in a history table to future references.

##  Devices (Register/De-Register) 

Devices are categorized in two types based on the usage. Registration Devices (used during registrations in Registration Client) and Auth Devices (used during authentication through Partners). Before being used, these devices are needed to be registered in MOSIP using the Register/De-Register API.

The Device is needed to be registered with the following attributes.

1. Device ID – Mandatory
2. Purpose – [Registration or Auth]
3. Device Sub Ids - (optional)
4. Signed Digital ID
5. Firmware
6. Device Expiry - (optional)
7. Certification Level – L0 or L1
8. Timestamp - ISO format date time with time-zone
9. Foundational Trust provider ID - Required only if certification level received is L1

Digital ID will be a signed base64 encoded Json Object. It will be decoded and stored in the Registered Device Table once the signature is validated with the root certificate issued to each Device Provider (for L0 devices) or Foundational Trust Provider (for L1 devices). 

Registration Device can only be registered if they exist in the list of white-listed devices.  Once a device is registered, a unique device code is generated for each device. For Registration devices, the code comes from the white-list table.

Once the device is registered, there details should not be changed. However, an Admin can change the status of the device. The device can have three different statuses: Registered, Retired, and Revoked. Once retired, a device can be re-registered by updating the its status, although same is not the case of Revoked devices as they cannot be re-registered once revoked. Any creation and modification in the details of a Device is maintained in a history table to future references.


##  Device Detail Validation 

Device Provider Management also provides an API to validate device details during Authentication in IDA or during packet validation in Registration Processor.

The API receives Device Code, Digital ID, and MDS Service Version and validates the following conditions.

1. The Device exist and is ‘Registered’ and ‘Active’
2. The Device is not Revoked or Retired
3. The Device Provider exist and is 'Active’
4. The MDS service against he software version is in the list and is marked ‘Active’
5. The MDS Software version matches against the Device Type, Device Sub Type, Make, Model and Provider ID of the device as received in input as part of Digital ID
6. The Device Code received matches against the Make, Model, Device Type, Device Sub Type, Serial Number, Provider Name and Provider ID of the device which received as part of Digital ID

For validation in IDA, the API checks the current status of the details, But for validation in Registration processor, API checks the status of details as on the packet generation date and time. For this, the API additionally receives packet generation timestamp.

# Multi-language Support 

## i18N

Admin portal provides support for multiple languages which can be configured by a country. The portal can support two languages one of which will be primary and another a secondary language. Both can be configured as per the Country’s requirements. The portal will render all the functionalities (View, Create and Update) in two languages thus allowing the Admin to access these functionality in both the languages simultaneously. Although the Home page, Labels and certain functionalities like ‘Viewing Packet Status based on RID’ will only be rendered in the primary language.

If a Country wants to use only one language in MOSIP, both primary and secondary language must be configured as the same language. If configured, the portal will render the screens in only one configured language. Although to be noted, both the primary and secondary languages must be configured. If not, The portal won’t allow the Admin to login and will be shown a message saying “The system has encountered a technical error. Administrator to setup the necessary language configuration(s)".
