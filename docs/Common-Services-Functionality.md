# Common Services
## 1. OTP Manager [**[↑]**](#table-of-contents)
### A. OTP Generation
1. OTP Manager Component handles OTP Generation and OTP Validation
1. For OTP Generation, system receives a request to generate an OTP along with a Key in input parameter. 
1. This Key can be a Mobile number, Email ID or a combination of Mobile Number and Email ID. 
1. The component generates an OTP as per the configured length and responds back with the OTP to the source. OTP manager maps an expiry period with the OTP as configured by the Admin.

### B. OTP Validation
1. For OTP Validation, system receives a request to validate an OTP with a Key and OTP in input parameter. 

1. The component validates the OTP against the expiry and then validates the OTP against the Key if the OTP is not expired. 

1. If the OTP is not expired and is valid against the Key, it will respond with message “Valid” else responds with “Invalid”. 

1. A user will have a maximum configured number of tries to get the OTP wrong after which he/she will be blocked for a configured amount of time. During this blocked period, he/she cannot generate or validate another OTP.

## 2. QR Code Generator [**[↑]**](#table-of-contents)
QR code generator takes the content received along with the version number and converts the content into a QR code. The version number is configurable and determines how much data a QR code can store. The more the version number, the more data can be stored in a QR Code.

## 3. Crypto Services [**[↑]**](#table-of-contents)
### 3.1 Cryptography Services [**[↑]**](#table-of-contents)
Crypto service encrypts or decrypts data across MOSIP with the help of Public/Private Keys.

#### A. For Encryption
The Crypto Service receives a request from an application with input parameters – Application ID, Reference ID, Timestamp and the Data which needs to be encrypted. 
The Service then calls the Key Generator API to get a symmetric Key and encrypts the data using that symmetric Key. 

The Service then calls the Key Manager Service with the Application ID and Timestamp received in the input parameters and gets the public key. 

The Service then encrypts the symmetric key using the Public key and joins the Encrypted data and Encrypted Symmetric Key using a Key splitter and respond to the source with the joined data.
#### B. For Decryption
The Crypto Service will receive a request from an application with input parameters – Application ID, Reference ID, Timestamp and Data that needs to be decrypted. 


The Application ID received will be the one, which was sent for encryption of data in the above flow. 


The Crypto Service then splits the received data into Encrypted Content and Encrypted Symmetric Key using the Key Splitter and then calls the Key Manager Service with the Encrypted Symmetric Key, Application ID and Timestamp to decrypt the data using private key.


The Key Manager instead of responding with the private key, decrypts the symmetric itself and send it back to the crypto service. The service then uses this symmetric key to decrypt data and send the decrypted data back to the source.

### 3.2 Key Generator [**[↑]**](#table-of-contents)
#### A. Generate a Symmetric Key

Upon receiving a request to generate symmetric key pair the system generates a key pair (public and private key) as defined below and responds with the symmetric key
* The symmetric key generated supports AES algorithm
* The symmetric key generated is of 256 bit size
* The symmetric will be returned as a byte array


#### B. Generate an Asymmetric Key

Upon receiving a request to generate asymmetric key pair the system generates a key pair (public and private key) as defined below and responds with the Asymmetric key
* The asymmetric key pair is generated using the RSA encryption
* The asymmetric key pair generated is of 2048 bit size
* The asymmetric is returned as a byte array

### 3.3 Key Management [**[↑]**](#table-of-contents)

1. The Key Manager Service works together with the Crypto Service. 
1. It receives a request from Crypto Service from Public Key with the Application ID and Timestamp. 
1. Key Manager Service then sends a valid Public key against the application ID received to Crypto Service. 
1. In case, the public key is expired against that Application ID, it will generate a new Public Key and respond with it.
1. When there is a request to decrypt data, the private key of the application id or reference id is used. The Key manager will not respond with Private Key but instead takes the encrypted data from the source and decrypts it itself and responds with decrypted content

### 4.1 OTP Notification Services [**[↑]**](#table-of-contents)
1. OTP Notification Services is a combined service, which receives a request to generate an OTP and responds directly to the User using SMS or Email Notification. 
1. The service receives a request to generate and send OTP with User ID, OTP Channel (MOBILE and/or EMAIL), Template Variables, and Template Context (SMS and/or Email). 
1. It then calls OTP Generator Service to generate an OTP against a Key (Mobile Number or Email). 
1. It calls the Template Merger Service to merge OTP with the Template (SMS and/or Email). 
1. It calls SMS and/or Email Notification Service to send the notification as per the template. 
1. The choice of sending SMS and/or Email depends on the Notification Type Flag received in Input.
1. The system responds with the error message if a particular User ID does not have an Email or Mobile number registered against it if the otp channel received is Email or Mobile number respectively 

### 4.2 Email Notification [**[↑]**](#table-of-contents)
