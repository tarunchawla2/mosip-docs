This document provides estimates for server machines and other hardware needed for a given production deployment.  _This is work-in-progress_.  Performance tuning of MOSIP is in progress so these figures are **rough estimates** at this point time.

# ID Authentication
* Peak load assumption:  2 million auth requests per day 
* Number of servers needed:  20  (4 CPU, 16 GB RAM)

# Registration Processor
* Peak load assumption:  200,000 registration packets per day 
* Number of servers needed:  80 (4 core, 16 GB RAM)

**Important notes**:

1.  The above are rough estimates we must add a margin of 30% for the unknowns.
1.  High availability is taken into consideration.
1.  The above estimates do not include hardware/servers needed for
    1. Data storage 
    1. Bio SDK:  compute requirements should be provided by the SDK vendor.
    1. HSM
    1. ABIS
    1. Virus scan
    1. Load balancers
    1. External IAM
    1. Disaster recovery:  Setup will be replicated, hence, double the number of servers.

# Bill of Material
