The **Modular Open Source Identity Platform ([MOSIP](https://mosip.io))** helps Governments and other user organizations implement a digital, foundational identity system.  Nations can use MOSIP freely as a core to build their own identity systems.  Being modular in its architecture, MOSIP provides flexibility to countries in how they implement and configure their systems, and helps avoid vendor lock-in.  Anchored at the International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore (IIIT-B), MOSIP harnesses the power of open source and embraces the best practices of scalability, security and privacy.

MOSIP provides the following basic functions:

* acquire an individual's identity data
* process the identity data to establish uniqueness
* generate a Unique Identity Number (UIN)
* authenticate an individual's identity where required to provide access to services such as healthcare, education, social security etc. 

The key objectives of the MOSIP Platform are to

* provide basic framework to create a fully functional identity system
* provide flexibility for a country to choose the features from the basic framework according to their requirements
* maintain privacy, security and confidentiality of an individual's data
* provide a scalable and accessible solution to cater to a wide range of population (a few thousands to tens of millions)
