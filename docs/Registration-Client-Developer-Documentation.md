# Registration Client Developer Documentation

*** 
This document guide the developer to find the traceability between functionality and the respective technical component.  The provided technical classes are available in the package of 'registration-service' module. In this module the required functions are exposed as public method and that can be used to obtain the required features.  

It doesn't detail about each methods level information since that are covered in Javadoc of each component.   

## Functionality Vs technical component mapping

|**Functionality:**| Login with UserName and Password/ OTP/ BIO  |

This object has the following sub-classes: a. DemographicDTO - Details of the Demographic and Documents, b. BiometricDTO - Biometrics (Fingerprints, Irises, Face and Exception Face) of the individual, parent (or guardian), officer and supervisor, c.  RegistrationMetaDataDTO - Metadata related to registration and d. OSIDataDTO - Details of the officer and supervisor who had authenticated the registration.  |

If an exception is marked for the parent bio-metrics, an exception photo will be captured for the parent| 
|**UIN Update - Adult**| As part of UIN Update, individual's will have the option to select the field that would like to update. For Demographic update --> UIN number, Name, Document[only if Name/Address is selected then POI for name and POA for address is mandate], and anyone of the bio-metric will be captured as a mandatory values. For Bio-metric update --> UIN number, Name and Bio-metrics [fingerprint, iris and face] will be captured, if an exception marked then exception photo will be captured|
|**UIN Update-Child**| As part of UIN Update, individual's will have the option to select which one they are going to be update. For Demographic update --> UIN Number, Name,POR document along with that Parent/Guardian Name and UIN along with anyone parent bio-metric should be captured; if any exception marked then the exception photo of the Parent/Guardian will be captured.|
|**Lost UIN-Adult**| As part of Lost UIN, an individual's all Bio-metrics[fingerprints, iris, and face] will be mandatory to find the lost UIN.| 
|**Lost UIN-Child**| As part of Lost UIN, Parent/Guardian  Bio-metric will be mandatory to find the lost UIN of the child. if an exception marked then the exception photo of the parent/Guardian will be captured.|

## List of Jobs
Below provided jobs are executed in batch mode through spring batch. The job execution frequencies are mentioned in the DB job related table. These jobs can also be triggered through manual process using 'Sync' option in the Menu, During initial login after successful online authentication and While starting the application if initial sync already completed.

## Configuration Rule
As 'configurability' is the one of the major NFR being considered while designing the application, here listed out the required files where the configurations can be modified that will get reflected in application during runtime.  
  - 'registration-qa.properties' - Registration application specific configuration.  
  - 'application-qa.properties' - Overall application level common configuration.  
  
These configuration would be downloaded to the client machine through the 'config' sync service.  If there is any change with respect to 'kernel' properties then after downloading the properties the application will ask for 'restart'. 
  
**Age configuration:**  
  - Age limit is configurable in the application. User should modify the max age limit in both 'application' and 'registration' properties file.      
  - {application property key : 'mosip.id.validation.identity.age'}    	
  - {registration property key : 'mosip.registration.max_age'}	


## Table Details
