# Overview
Registration Processor processes the data (demographic and biometric) of an Individual for quality and uniqueness and then issues a Unique Identification Number (UIN). It also provides functionality to update demographic and biometric data and issue a new UIN if lost.  The source of data are primarily from
- MOSIP Registration Client
- Existing ID system(s) of a country

Important considerations are as follows:

* Once the packet is received on the server packets should not be lost.  
* MOSIP defines and implement the basics registration packet processing flow. However, every country will have their own processing requirements  like integration with their existing ID system and fetch data for validation.  Registrataion processor provides options to add such stages.
* Registration processor has the capability to integrate with multiple ABIS providers.
* Each processing stage is scalable independently based on the load.
* Each stage in the processor is independent of other stages such that logic of a stage can be changed to improve efficiency without affecting the overall flow
